Prototype of clients for a social network based on image sharing. In short, each user has one or more friends who follows, similar to what happens in other social networks. A user can publish a status message associated with an image; all users who follow it will be able to see the image and the message.
This is the content of the "WWW" folder of a Phonegap project.
The system is based on a server that may no longer be operational.
